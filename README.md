## > Concept (Hwow Tridoku can be implemented with the concept of vertex Colouring)
Triduko with vertex colouring

* Each small triangle value in Trikodu represents a vertex

* The edges between these coloured vertices ensure that
  1. There are unique values in each triangles out of the four
larger triangles.
  2. All the values/vertices of small Triangles forming any side
border of the larger triangle are different/unique.

## > Rules
1. All the numbers of a triangle should be unique
2. All the numbers for any side of the Tridoku must be unique

## > Output
